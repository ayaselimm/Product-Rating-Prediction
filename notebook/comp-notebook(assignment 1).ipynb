    "# Describe the issue:\n",
    "When a new product is to be listed on wish.com, we can estimate the likelihood that people will like it without actually placing it there. We were provided a dataset gathered from wise.com and instructed to create machine learning models in order to be able to predict the rating of a specific product.additionally, we can predict when a product will receive a high rating on wise.com thanks to the interpretability of machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "What's the input?\n",
    "\n",
    "Two files were sent to us: one for testing and one for training.The features that we discussed above are contained in the two files:\n",
    ". price the price of the piece.\n",
    ". retail price the retails price.\n",
    ". units sold the number of sold pieces.\n",
    ". uses ads boosts if the merchant you ads.\n",
    ". rating count the number of rating for this product.\n",
    ". badges count the number of badges the product and merchant have.\n",
    ". badge product quality a badge which is given for the good products.\n",
    ". badge fast shipping indicating that the merchent fast ship the pieces.\n",
    ". product color the color of the product.\n",
    ". product variation size the size of the piece.[medium ,large,small,..].\n",
    ". product variation inverntory the variation in the inverntory.\n",
    ". shipping option price\n",
    ". has urgency bannerif there is a urgency text for the product [limited edition - sale ....].\n",
    ". origin country the country of the manufacturer.\n",
    ". merchant rating count the number of rating the merchant has on wise.\n",
    ". merchant rating the rating of the merchant.\n",
    ". merchant has profile picturethe flag indicating the availability of merchant picture.\n",
    ". merchant profile picture link of the picture.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "what is the output?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this work, which involved supervising a machine learning classification task, we were required to forecast the product's rating as a number, ranging from 1 to 5.\n",
    "features an urgency banner in the event that the product has an urgency text (limited edition - sale, etc.).\n",
    "origin nation, the nation where the product is made.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the data mining function?\n",
    "\n",
    "We are using data mining's classification functionality to solve this challenge.\n",
    "Nonetheless, I first went through the machine learning process, which is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data cleaning includes managing null values, removing columns that have a constant value, and handling inconsistent columns.\n",
    "information To address the skewness of some columns in the numerical preprocessing, I used a conventional scaler and a log transform \n",
    "arranging Define the task as a classification problem, choose an evaluation measure, and then test various models with various features and hyperparameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "What could be the challenges?\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset had numerous inconsistent columns, including those for the merchant subtitle information, product variation size id, color, and tags. It was highly biased and misformatted, so I began by determining whether there were any duplicates in the data, dealing with the inconsistent data entry, performing a variety of feature selection techniques, and experimenting with different models to determine which one would work best for our situation.then makes it even better.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the impact?\n",
    "\n",
    "It's very difficult to collect data for some products for business purposes because we can't force the end user to rate if he doesn't want to. Therefore, we try to list only those products that will have high rates, which will help both the merchant and the customer sell their products. Additionally, by predicting the product's rate before listing it on the platform, this will help the companies determine whether the product will be accepted by the customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "What is an ideal solution?\n",
    "\n",
    "possessing an infinite number of records, which will enable us to create the best model without worrying about overfitting. We also have other models that operate by grouping customers based on their interests so they can only view products that align with their interests, improving the customer's experience on the platform and helping merchants boost sales. And because we lack all of that, I attempted to create a model using the dataset provided, which yields a f1-score of roughly 0.76 We still need to collect more information and revisit this issue in order to improve the model and try to outperform it.\n"
